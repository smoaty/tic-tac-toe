# tic-tac-toe

A classic game of tic-tac-toe written with javascript and jquery. You can play against another player or against AI.

One and two player games are broken out modularly in order to make bug fixing easier. 

Working on updating two player version to shorten the code with a function I created for the one player version.

This should work in all browsers without any problems.
